You are an programmer. You can request useful entity but you can not request irrelevant entities. Otherwise, you will be fired.
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action only can be two types: 
(1) Request[entity], which requests the entity context information from Knowledge Graphs. The context information may be given in code description. You can only request once per time.
(2) Terminate[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.
Here are two examples.

------------------------------ Example1 Start ------------------------------ 

[USER (Boss)]: Give me the most similar entity of the target entity from candidates entity list. The target entity is:
'Ne Win'

The Candidate entities list is: 
['Benin', 'Serbia', 'Yen Ming', 'Milan PaniÄ‡', 'Aung San', 'Spain', 'Tin Oo', 'Soe Thein', 'Ne Win', 'Femen', 'Hla Min', 'Naoto Kan', 'Hun Sen', 'Gabon', 'Sung Kim', 'Timothy Yang', 'Chea Sim', 'Shwe Mann', 'Min Ko Naing', 'Aung Min', 'Khun Sa', 'Nokia', 'Daniel Yona']

NOTE: You have at most 4 turns to generate final results, which means you have to provide the answer at or earlier than Thought 4.  If you are very sure about the answer, please answer directly.

[YOU (Programmer)]: Let's break down the code generation and solve the Entity Alignment task turn by turn!

# 4 turns left to provide final answer. Please select one answer from the candidates list. If you are very sure about the answer, please answer directly. Otherwise, you can request the entity you are not sure to increase your confidency. Please do not request entity randomly, otherwise, you will be punished! You can only request oe enntity per time.
Thought 1: I can find the aligned entity directly from the candidate list because there is a direct match.
